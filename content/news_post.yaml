      body: "<p><strong>ST. PETERSBURG, FL & CHICAGO, IL –&nbsp;November 6, 2019 –</strong>&nbsp;Kin, the insurance startup reinventing home insurance for catastrophe-prone areas with easy, affordable coverage and world-class customer service, today announced the launch of its new mobile home insurance offering for Floridians and the opening of its office in St. Petersburg. <a href=\"/mobile-home-insurance/\">Kin’s mobile home insurance</a> offering is available now, and with its unique approach to catastrophe modeling data and pricing experience, mobile home insurance quotes can be generated in minutes.</p>\n<p>“Historically, we’ve seen insurance companies enter then leave catastrophe-prone markets like Florida, leaving homeowners without policies and vulnerable to natural disasters. But home insurance shouldn’t work that way,” said Sean Harper, CEO and co-founder of Kin. “Rather, homeowners should have the power to make informed decisions about their providers and policies. So, we’re doubling down in Florida where reliable homeowners insurance and other reliable insurance products, like mobile home insurance, are needed.”</p>\n<p>In Florida, there are more than 800,000 mobile homes, and Kin’s policies cover mobile homes on private property, in a mobile home park, or in a subdivision. Kin’s mobile home policies include replacement-cost coverage for the dwelling, belongings, other structures (e.g., fences), additional living expenses, personal liability, and medical payments.</p>\n<p>Brought on to lead the new Tampa Bay office, Kin welcomes Angel Conlin as chief legal officer and Jason Fraley as managing director of engineering. As former counsel for Nationwide and ASI/Progressive Home, Conlin brings an in-depth understanding of the Southeastern United States, from regulation to compliance, as well as extensive industry experience.</p>\n<p>“With 98% of Florida’s total population living in coastal counties susceptible to hurricane and flood damage, Florida is a unique insurance market that requires a keen awareness of the different coastal communities and the insurance challenges they face. I’m excited to join a team that’s reimagining what insurance can do for Floridians,” said Conlin.</p>\n<p>Kin is currently hiring new and experienced engineers, developers, customer service representatives, and insurance representatives, including agents and underwriters, in both offices. By mid-next year, Kin is expected to grow its Florida-based engineering team by 500% or more.</p>\n<p>“As fellow homeowners, we understand the insurance application process can be overwhelming. That’s why Kin leverages multiple existing data points as well as new derivative data elements to build better, affordable home insurance quotes based on real numbers that are more than best guesses or industry standard,” added Fraley.</p>\n<p>Kin is committed to serving those living in catastrophe-prone regions and impacted by natural disasters, such as hurricanes and floods. Earlier this year, Kin announced the launch of the Kin Interinsurance Network, a Florida home insurance carrier, that serves coastal homeowners often neglected by the insurance industry.</p>\n<p><strong>About Kin</strong></p>\n<p>Kin Insurance is an insurtech startup and licensed insurance carrier that is fixing home insurance through intuitive tech, affordable pricing, and world-class customer service. By leveraging thousands of publicly available data points, Kin can recommend the appropriate coverage at affordable prices for homeowners. Launched by seasoned financial tech entrepreneurs Sean Harper and Lucas Ward in 2016, Kin is the first insurtech company to serve catastrophe-prone regions and is committed to helping coastal homeowners most impacted by climate change. The company is headquartered in Chicago with an office in Tampa Bay and currently serves Florida, Texas, Georgia, and Alabama, with plans to expand across the U.S. Kin is currently hiring in its Chicago and Tampa Bay offices. For more information, visit www.kin.com.</p>\n<p><strong>About Angel Conlin</strong></p>\n<p>Angel Conlin, Kin's chief legal officer, is a proven senior insurance executive with over 20 years of P&amp;C insurance experience in both large and small companies. She brings experience in business leadership, compliance oversight, legislative advocacy, policy forms, litigation and counsel management, and more. She most recently spent nine years as general counsel for ASI/Progressive Home. She was part of the executive leadership team that grew ASI from a five-state carrier to a $1.5 billion, A+ rated insurance group offering homeowners/dwelling, renters, flood, and umbrella insurance products in 44 states. She established and led the legal, compliance &amp; policy forms team, including claims attorneys, corporate attorneys, compliance professionals, forms specialists, a product specialist, and paralegals. Prior to ASI, she spent 10 years at Nationwide, ultimately as AVP regional counsel leading the legal team in overseeing all legal matters for the southeast region.</p>\n<p><strong>About Jason Fraley</strong></p>\n<p>Jason Fraley, Kin’s managing director of engineering, is a 30-year information technology veteran. For the first half of his career, he built global-scale systems for GTE/Verizon and Oracle/Sun Microsystems.

      body: "<p><strong>CHICAGO, IL – April 18, 2022 –</strong> Kin Insurance today announced that the Kin Interinsurance Network, its reciprocal insurance carrier, has successfully closed a $175 million private placement catastrophe bond transaction. Kin entered into a multi-year reinsurance arrangement with Hestia Re Ltd., a newly established special purpose insurer in Bermuda (“Hestia Re”), which will provide the Kin Interinsurance Network with indemnity-based coverage for large hurricanes and other named storms affecting the State of Florida.</p>\n<p>“Our first catastrophe bond will be an integral part of Kin’s broader reinsurance program which protects our company,” said Angel Conlin, chief insurance officer at Kin. “The transaction also highlights our strong support from capital market investors, continued backing by industry-leading reinsurers, and ability to bring more capital directly into our growing business, which will be important as we explore subsequent alternative risk transfer options in the future.”</p>\n<p>Although the transaction was announced with an initial target of $100 million, the catastrophe bond was upsized to $175 million based on the support received from investors. Swiss Re Capital Markets and TigerRisk Capital Markets &amp; Advisory acted as joint structuring agents and joint bookrunners on the transaction.</p>\n<p>“Swiss Re Capital Markets is proud to have advised Kin in structuring and placing its first-ever catastrophe bond,” said Andras Bohm, head ILS structuring for the Americas of Swiss Re Capital Markets. “The success of the transaction and upsize to $175 million are a testament to ILS investors' willingness to provide catastrophe risk capacity in support of Kin's fast-growing and technology-driven direct-to-consumer business model.”</p>\n<p>Philipp&nbsp;Kusche, global head of ILS and capitalsolutions at TigerRisk Capital Markets &amp; Advisory, added:&nbsp;“We are delighted to have supported Kin in its inaugural catastrophe bond transaction, which comes on the heels of the establishment of Hestia Re.

      body: "<p><strong>ST. PETERSBURG, FL & CHICAGO, IL – December 4, 2019 –</strong> Kin, the insurance technology company reinventing home insurance for catastrophe-prone areas with easy, affordable coverage and world-class customer service, announced it now offers two new discounts for Florida homeowners.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"/faq/responsible-repair-discount/\">Responsible Repair Discount</a>, an industry first, offers an 18% discount on the water peril premium for an average discount of five percent off the total premium and is made possible by the passage of Insurance Assignment Agreements (SB 122, HB 7065). The e-Policy Discount provides another $10 premium discount. Both discounts will be live for all policies with an effective date of December 2, 2019 or later.</p>\n<p>“While other carriers may increase their rates, we’re lowering ours. With this legislation, we can now offer a discount to our Florida-based customers who do not assign their benefits to third parties, and we’ll continue to look for ways to better serve and simplify the home insurance process for Florida homeowners,” said Sean Harper, co-founder and CEO of Kin.</p>\n<p>The bill, which was passed by the Florida Legislature and signed into law by Governor Ron DeSantis, makes the Responsible Repair Discount possible. The bill pertains to an assignments of benefits (AOB) agreement, which is an agreement that, once signed, transfers the insurance claims rights or benefits of a consumer’s insurance policy to a third party. It gives the third party authority to file a claim, make repair decisions and collect insurance payments without the consumer’s involvement.</p>\n<p>According to the Insurance Information Institute, abuse of AOB has fueled a crisis in Florida as the state has seen a 70% increase in AOB-related lawsuits from 2013-2018. AOB abuse has also cost Floridians billions in premiums to address unnecessary or overly expensive repairs as well as legal fees.</p>\n<p>“Kin remains committed to serving the state of Florida, which is already a complex insurance market facing natural disasters, and consumer feedback indicates a very strong desire for the Responsible Repair Discount. We believe the majority of our Florida-based customers don't want to assign their rights to a third party and instead, would prefer a discount for agreeing not to,” said Angel Conlin, Kin’s St. Petersburg-based chief legal officer.</p>\n<p>These policy discounts follow the announcement of Kin’s mobile home insurance offering in Florida and the launch of Kin’s Florida home insurance carrier, the Kin Interinsurance Network. Kin has offices in Chicago and St. Petersburg. Both offices are currently hiring new and experienced engineers, developers, customer service as well as insurance representatives, including agents and underwriters to serve policyholders in and beyond Florida.</p>\n<p><strong>About Kin</strong></p>\n<p>Kin Insurance is an insurtech startup and licensed insurance carrier that is fixing home insurance through intuitive tech, affordable pricing, and world-class customer service. By leveraging thousands of publicly available data points, Kin can recommend the appropriate coverage at affordable prices for homeowners. Launched by seasoned financial tech entrepreneurs Sean Harper and Lucas Ward in 2016, Kin is the first insurtech company to serve catastrophe-prone regions and is committed to helping coastal homeowners most impacted by climate change. The company is headquartered in Chicago with an office in Tampa Bay and currently serves Florida, Texas, Georgia, and Alabama, with plans to expand across the U.S. Kin is currently hiring in its Chicago and Tampa Bay offices.

      body: "<p><strong>CHICAGO, IL – April 19, 2021 –</strong>&nbsp;Kin, the insurance technology company transforming home insurance through intuitive tech and affordable pricing, today announced that it surpassed $100 million in annual recurring premium after just 21 months as a carrier, a feat accomplished with only $52 million in equity funding.</p>\n<p>On average, even the fastest growing tech companies require six years to scale from $1 million to $100 million in annual recurring revenue, according to the <a href=\"https://www.bvp.com/atlas/state-of-the-cloud-2021\">2021 State of the Cloud report</a> from Bessemer Venture Partners. Kin started its reciprocal exchange insurance carrier in July 2019, taking only a year and three quarters to reach this significant milestone – or about 70% faster than expected based on that benchmark.</p>\n<p>Kin reached $25 million in annual recurring premium in March 2020, and grew to $100 million only a year later, quadrupling year-over-year.</p>\n<p>Kin’s rapid rise is particularly noteworthy given that it’s the only direct-to-consumer, homeowners-focused insurance tech company. Homeowners insurance is still 93% sold through brick-and-mortar agencies.</p>\n<p>“The world is changing fast: technology, consumer preferences, demographics, even the weather,” said Sean Harper, co-founder and CEO of Kin. “Our rapid growth shows how eager customers are for an insurance company built for the modern world, not the world as it was 100 years ago.”</p>\n<p>With a technology-first approach to homeowners insurance, Kin has made coverage accessible and affordable even for homes at risk for extreme weather. Previously homeowners in regions most impacted by climate change had to rely on legacy providers with outdated risk models that dramatically increased rates or denied coverage altogether.</p>\n<p>Kin is currently available in California, Florida, and Louisiana, which make up 21% of the home insurance market, and plans to expand nationally before the year’s end.</p>\n<p><strong>About Kin</strong></p>\n<p>Kin is the home insurance company built for the future.

      body: "<p><strong>CHICAGO, IL – June 3, 2021 –</strong> Kin, the insurance technology company that makes home insurance easy and affordable, today announced its newest funding from Symphony Ventures, an investment partnership established by professional golfer Rory McIlroy and his team. Joining Symphony Ventures was Flourish Ventures, the global fintech fund founded by Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay, bringing the total capital raised in this round to $69.2 million. The round was originally co-led by Hudson Structured Capital Management Ltd. (doing its re/insurance business as HSCM Bermuda) and Senator Investment Group.</p>\n<p>\"We are thrilled to secure Rory as our latest investor, as Kin now joins the ranks of his high-profile partnerships and investments in truly innovative technology companies,\" said Sean Harper, co-founder and CEO of Kin. \"As climate change continues to impact many regions like Florida and Louisiana, access to affordable home insurance is a priority that is often overlooked. With Kin, we analyze more than 10,000 property data points in comparison to the mere hundreds assessed by legacy insurance providers, which makes us better equipped to evaluate the risk and price policies fairly.\"</p>\n<p>Whereas legacy insurers rely on outdated, inflexible technology, Kin's proprietary platform allows the company to price risks in real time and ingest more data than competitors. Kin's technology also reduces general and administrative expenses, which constitute roughly 15% of premiums at legacy homeowners insurance companies. Finally, by selling its products directly to consumers, Kin eliminates the expense of paying outside agents.</p>\n<p>\"Our focus in Symphony Ventures is to partner with technology companies that have a digital-first approach and who are truly innovating our day-to-day lives,\" said McIlroy. \"As a Florida resident who has toured the world on the PGA Tour, I've seen the devastation that severe weather and climate change can have on communities. This is why I am delighted to invest in Kin to help expand their offerings to new geographies, providing simpler solutions direct to the consumer.\"</p>\n<p>Kin currently operates in Florida and Louisiana – a strategic decision to focus first on regions most impacted by climate change and natural disasters because they need affordable solutions now. Priority regions for expansion include Texas and the Gulf Coast, and hurricane-prone regions that touch the Atlantic Ocean.</p>\n<p><strong>About Kin</strong></p>\n<p>Kin is the home insurance company built for the future.

      body: "<p><strong>ST. PETERSBURG, FL & CHICAGO, IL – January 21, 2020 –</strong>&nbsp;Kin, the insurance technology company reinventing home insurance for catastrophe-prone areas, today announced it now offers flood coverage for Florida homeowners. The flood coverage is an insurance endorsement and can be tailored to Florida homeowners in areas deemed low-risk, moderate-risk, or high-risk for floods. The product is available now through Kin’s Florida home insurance carrier, the Kin Interinsurance Network, which launched last August.</p>\n<p>\"Flood coverage provides critical protection, and every Florida homeowner should consider purchasing it, especially since the majority of Florida’s homeowners do not currently have flood coverage,\" said Angel Conlin, Kin’s St. Petersburg-based chief legal officer. \"In general, many U.S. homeowners mistakenly assume that flood coverage is provided in standard homeowners policies when it is not.\"</p>\n<p>Most standard homeowners insurance policies don’t cover flood damage from storm surges. While damage from <a href=\"/blog/water-damage-home-insurance/\">a burst water pipe</a> may be covered, the damage from floods that accompany hurricanes isn’t. That’s why flood insurance is typically sold as a separate policy if it’s offered by private insurers at all.</p>\n<p>\"Because Kin’s flood coverage can be added to the homeowners insurance policy, Kin’s Florida customers only need to pay one premium for both home and flood coverage. This eliminates the extra time and cost of having separate policies and working with separate insurance companies,\" said Sean Harper, Kin’s CEO and co-founder. \"We understand these challenges and want to make getting flood coverage as easy as possible for homeowners.\"</p>\n<p>Although Florida’s coastal counties are prone to flooding, less than half (42%) of coastal county homeowners have flood insurance. The Insurance Information Institute notes approximately \"98% of the total population of Florida lives in one of the coastal counties,\" which indicates a significant portion of Florida homeowners do not have flood coverage.</p>\n<p>However, flooding isn’t limited to coastal counties. In fact, FEMA reports that as of 2018, 98% of U.S. counties have flooded. The Insurance Information Institute also reports that 90% of U.S. natural disasters involve flooding.</p>\n<p>\"Kin remains committed to building better home insurance that fits Florida homeowners' budgets. Coastal homeowners, including those living in flood zones, deserve affordable and reliable coverage that doesn’t compromise protection,\" added Harper.</p>\n<p><strong>About Kin</strong></p>\n<p>Kin Insurance is an insurtech startup and licensed Florida insurance carrier that is fixing home insurance through intuitive tech, affordable pricing, and world-class customer service. By leveraging thousands of publicly available data points, Kin can recommend the appropriate coverage at affordable prices for homeowners. Launched by seasoned financial tech entrepreneurs Sean Harper and Lucas Ward in 2016, Kin is the first insurtech company to serve catastrophe-prone regions and is committed to helping coastal homeowners most impacted by climate change. The company is headquartered in Chicago with an office in Tampa Bay, and is currently hiring in both offices.

      body: "<p><strong>CHICAGO, IL –&nbsp;August 13, 2020 –</strong>&nbsp;Kin, the insurance technology company that makes home insurance easy and affordable, today announced a $35 million Series B round. The funding was led by Commerce Ventures with participation from Hudson Structured Capital Management Ltd. (doing its reinsurance business as HSCM Bermuda), Flourish Ventures, QED, Alpha Edison, Allegis NL Capital, Avanta Ventures (venture arm of CSAA Insurance Group, a AAA Insurer), August Capital, the University of Chicago via its Startup Investment Program, and others.</p>\n<p>This round brings Kin’s total funding to date to $86 million. The investment comes less than a year after Kin received regulatory approval for the Kin Interinsurance Network (KIN), its reciprocal exchange – a form of insurance company that shares underwriting profits with customers. With its latest round of funding, the company plans to bring its solution, piloted in Florida, to homeowners across the U.S., starting with states most affected by severe weather.</p>\n<p>\"We believe in creating meaningful change for homeowners who need our solution the most,\" said Sean Harper, co-founder and CEO of Kin. \"Since we established our carrier last summer, we have been able to innovate much faster because we depend less on legacy insurance infrastructure.\"</p>\n<p>Whereas legacy insurers rely on outdated, inflexible technology, Kin’s proprietary platform allows the company to develop and launch new products in as little as a week, price risks in real time, and ingest more data than competitors. Kin’s technology also reduces general and administrative expenses, which constitute roughly 15% of premiums at legacy homeowner’s insurance companies.</p>\n<p>Kin also differs from legacy companies by selling its products directly to consumers rather than through outside agents. Traditional insurers spend about 17% of premiums paying outside agents and maintaining the infrastructure to support them. By selling directly to consumers, Kin eliminates those costs.</p>\n<p>\"As early investors in Kin, we're excited to see how fast the company has grown from startup into a market-leader for directly marketed homeowner’s insurance,\" said Dan Rosen, founder of Commerce Ventures. \"While many insurers spend much of their gross margin paying third-party agents, Kin has eliminated those costs, thus making the experience both simpler and more affordable for customers.”</p>\n<p>By structuring as a reciprocal exchange, Kin has aligned interests with policyholders. Because policyholders actually own the exchange, they benefit when claims are low and have a voice in what the company does.</p>\n<p>\"We are excited to increase our investment in Kin and to continue to support the company’s mission to provide simple and affordable insurance coverage to homeowners,\" said Andrew Sagon, vice president with HSCM Bermuda. \"Kin’s leadership team has done a commendable job of transferring structural efficiency gains to its customers in the form of more affordable coverage, and we are thrilled to support Kin’s efforts as the business enters its next phase of growth.\"</p>\n<p>Kin’s web and mobile platform transforms the process of securing home insurance, making insurance more accessible than ever. This creates an insurance experience that is fast, easy, and driven by customer care.</p>\n<p>\"Avanta Ventures, the venture capital arm of CSAA Insurance Group, is excited to invest and partner with Kin Insurance that is successfully leveraging technology, data, and analytics to better understand risk and underwriting for homeowners insurance to benefit members,\" said Sanjiv Parikh, managing partner at Avanta Ventures.</p>\n<p>\"Kin is the insurance company that all the incumbents want to be,\" said Emmalyn Shaw, managing partner of Flourish Ventures. \"With a relentless focus on customer needs and outstanding business execution, the A-rated company now offers the lowest-cost, most customizable products on the market and boasts an impressive NPS of 84, which is about double the industry average. If its <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">success in the Florida homeowners market</a> is an indication of what's to come, Kin is well positioned to become the next great national insurance firm.\"</p>\n<p>To support its growth, Kin is actively hiring tech and sales talent in both Chicago, Illinois, and St. Petersburg, Florida.

      body: "<p><strong>CHICAGO, IL – September 29, 2020 –</strong>&nbsp;Kin, the insurance technology company reinventing home insurance for those most impacted by climate change, announced it will begin serving <a href=\"/home-insurance/california/\">homeowners throughout California</a>. Now Californians can use Kin’s online platform to get homeowners insurance quotes in minutes, customize their coverage, and get insured online or over the phone.</p>\n<p>Kin is expanding into California in response to the state’s unprecedented increase in wildfire activity and the strain it has created for many homeowners. In 2018, insurance claims for California’s wildfire season reached $12 billion, and after recent wildfires, including the 2018 Camp Fire, many Californians weren’t eligible to renew their policies with their existing insurance company before the insurance commissioner put a one-year cancelation ban in place. Last year, an estimated 350,000 California home and business owners were unable to get property and casualty insurance at all.</p>\n<p>“Kin is entering the California market because of its wildfire risk, not in spite of it,” said Sean Harper, co-founder and CEO of Kin. “We're ready to put our technology to work for Californians, ensuring they have an affordable, private-market coverage option.”</p>\n<p>Kin built its platform from the ground up to instantly access and assess thousands of property data points about each home, sparing homeowners from answering complicated questions when applying for coverage. With its multiple radii-based exposure accumulator, Kin can determine a home’s true disaster exposure within a few miles of the home. This ensures coverage is priced accurately and fairly, reflecting the home’s actual risk.</p>\n<p>With its emphasis on customer service and innovation, Kin is proud to serve homeowners in need of easy, affordable coverage. Kin’s entry into California is backed by Falls Lake Fire and Casualty Company, rated A (Excellent) by A.M. Best, and through a partnership with Digital Partners, a Munich Re company.</p>\n<p>“Digital Partners is excited to partner with insurtechs like Kin who are innovating data utilization and digitalizing the insurance value chain,” said Dave Brune, North American CEO, Digital Partners, a Munich Re company. “Our goal is to provide support through a comprehensive, go-to-market partnership combining the financial strength and expertise of Munich Re with the ingenuity of Kin.”</p>\n<p>Terry McCafferty, CEO of Falls Lake Insurance, said: “Falls Lake is excited to team up with Kin and Digital Partners to provide coverage and solutions to managing the unique risks facing California homeowners. Kin’s distribution strategy, unique platform, and ability to understand risk at the location level is unique and best in class, and it presents a great opportunity to continue to expand our fronting business.”</p>\n<p>The financial strength of this partnership ensures consumers and their claims are protected in the event of a widespread catastrophe. With its <a href=\"/about/financial-strength/\">track record of consumer transparency and financial health</a>, Kin is eager to serve Californians and bring affordable, easy insurance options to the state’s insurance market.</p>\n<p><strong>About Kin</strong></p>\n<p>Kin Insurance is an insurance technology company that exists to change home insurance from what it is, to what it should be. Founded in 2016 by seasoned financial technology entrepreneurs Sean Harper and Lucas Ward, Kin leverages thousands of property data points to customize coverage and prices through a super simple user experience.

      body: "<p><strong>CHICAGO, IL – May 5, 2022 –</strong> Kin, the direct-to-consumer home insurance company built for every new normal, today announced select preliminary operating results through the first quarter ended March 31, 2022:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Kin finished the first quarter of 2022 with $54.1 million in gross written premium, over three times more than the $16.4 million of gross written premium in the prior-year period.</li>\n<li>$52.9 million (98%) of gross written premium in the first quarter of 2022 was written through the Kin Interinsurance Network (the “Carrier”), a reciprocal exchange managed by Kin Insurance, Inc.</li>\n<li>Adjusted loss ratio on the Carrier was 60.4% in the first quarter of 2022, a 25.2% improvement over the prior-year period.</li>\n<li>Gross profit from Kin’s management operations grew 255% to $15.6 million, compared to $4.4 million in the prior-year period.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/summary-of-financials.png\" alt=\"\" /><br />\n“We’re off to an incredible start having beat our quarterly goal for gross written premium by nearly 16%,” said Sean Harper, CEO of Kin. “While we’re growing faster than ever, we’re doing it very efficiently and generating attractive unit economics, including a 8.0x LTV/CAC ratio and a premium renewal rate that’s trending above 100%.”</p>\n<p>Kin’s early success will enable the company to focus more on decreasing its adjusted loss ratio and accelerate its path to profitability. Through the first quarter of 2022, Kin’s adjusted loss ratio decreased to 60.4% from 80.8% in the prior-year period. Non-cat adjusted loss ratio was 41.3% in the first quarter of 2022, and has decreased on an inception to date basis each of the last four quarters.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/adjusted-loss-ratio.png\" alt=\"\" /><br />\n“In four of the last five years, the average combined loss ratio has been above 100 across the U.S. homeowners industry, and it’s been even worse in some of the catastrophe-exposed states where we operate,” added Kin’s Chief Insurance Officer Angel Conlin. “In difficult times like these, we believe our DNA as a technology company enables us to respond to changes in the market faster and ultimately achieve better results.”</p>\n<p>Harper noted that the current challenging homeowners environment is one that plays to Kin’s strengths as a direct-to-consumer company. “Inflationary periods are not generally good for insurance companies, as rate increases usually lag loss-cost increases,” said Harper. “However, inflation is good for insurance agents, because premiums increase without increasing the amount of work necessary to service a policy. With our direct model, we have an advantage in this environment because we combine the economic profile of the agent with that of the carrier, which offset each other.”</p>\n<p>Kin’s operating leverage also improved in the first quarter of 2022, as gross profit grew over three times faster than operating expenses on a year-over-year basis.</p>\n<p>“We showed meaningful operating leverage as we experienced revenue growth and narrowed our operating loss,” said Josh Cohen, CFO of Kin. “We’re well-positioned to not just hit our annual goal of $250 million in gross written premium, but also make further progress towards our financial goals that prioritize profitability.”</p>\n<p><strong>About Kin</strong></p>\n<p>Kin is the home insurance company for every new normal.

Growth was entirely organic and directly written without the use of independent agents.</li>\n<li>$22.9 million (93%) of second quarter 2021 total written premium was written through the Kin Interinsurance Network (the “Carrier”), a reciprocal exchange managed by Kin Insurance, Inc.</li>\n<li>Premium renewal rate on the Carrier remained strong at 92% in the second quarter of 2021.</li>\n<li>Gross profit from Kin’s management operations grew 354% to $6.8 million, compared to $1.5 million in the prior-year comparative period.</li>\n<li>Operating loss of $6.9 million was unchanged compared to the first quarter of 2021.</li>\n<li>Adjusted loss ratio on the Carrier for the first half of 2021 was 67%, a 29 point improvement compared to 96% in the prior-year period.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>“We performed well in the second quarter, increasing our pace of growth year over year while maintaining our peer-leading unit economics. We also grew total written premium by 50% on a sequential basis, while only growing expenses by 21%,” said Sean Harper, CEO of Kin. “Customers continue to choose Kin because of our efficient pricing, tech-forward product and exceptional customer service.”</p>\n<p>The Kin Interinsurance Network, the customer-owned reciprocal exchange managed by Kin, had a first half 2021 adjusted loss ratio of 67%, a significant improvement from 96% in the prior-year period. Because the Kin Interinsurance Network is a reciprocal exchange that collects surplus contributions from policyholders, adjusted loss ratio includes the pro-rated portion of the surplus contributions to appropriately compare Kin’s loss ratio to industry peers that do not have this unique feature.</p>\n<p>“Kin’s technology and direct-to-consumer business model enable us to better execute on sound insurance pricing, underwriting and claims principles,” said Angel Conlin, chief insurance officer of Kin. “We believe our data advantage enables our team of expert actuaries and data scientists to apply our pricing and underwriting more accurately than legacy insurance companies that are more reliant on user and agent input data. This is exciting validation of our continued commitment to actuarially sound pricing, while delighting customers, evidenced in our stable renewal rate.”</p>\n<p><strong>About Kin</strong></p>\n<p>Kin is the home insurance company for every new normal.

      body: "<p><strong>CHICAGO, IL –&nbsp;September 27, 2017 –</strong>&nbsp;Kin, a Chicago-based home insurance company, announced the launch of its new AI-based home insurance recommendation platform on Monday. This technology replaces traditional insurance agents by providing better insurance advice, faster, and cheaper.</p>\n<p>This new technology makes better recommendations by combining artificial intelligence with an exhaustive data set about the home and the customer, including more than 5,000 variables. “Our platform is great at gathering all the information about a home and customer, which we have always used in our underwriting. Now, we can take that data and make expert recommendations to the customer based on those variables, as well as neighborhood context and the shifting risks facing homeowners” said Lucas Ward, CTO of Kin Insurance.</p>\n<p>Since the recommendations are being made by AI, the customer saves time and money. “Getting recommendations from an insurance agent often takes several days of back and forth, including filling out forms, answering questions on the phone, emails, and even in-person visits. Our AI provides better advice immediately, any time of the day,” said Sean Harper, CEO of Kin Insurance. “As a bonus, it cuts out the 15-20% of commissions typically paid to an insurance agent, saving the customer money.”</p>\n<p>The AI frequently uncovers risks about a home that neither a homeowner nor insurance agent would know, and makes sure the homeowner is informed and properly covered. \"Our world is getting increasingly risky, and insurance agents can’t keep up. For example, look what happened with Hurricane Harvey, where millions of people had flood damage and were not covered by flood policies,\" said Harper. \"The AI learns and responds to the changing world and make sure that our clients are appropriately covered.\"</p>\n<p>The platform will also protect homeowners as their policies age. \"Two-thirds of homes are underinsured. A policy may have been good enough when initially purchased, but the situation changed, resulting in the homeowner having to pay out of pocket when the home is damaged,\" said Ward.</p>\n<p>The new platform is the latest step in Kin’s effort to improve accuracy and lower costs of home insurance policies.</p>\n<p><strong>About Kin</strong></p>\n<p>Kin uses data and technology to streamline homeowners insurance, saving homeowners time and money.

It also covers investors who rent their properties on Airbnb. This policy can cover all sources of damage to the physical structure of the home except those listed as exclusions. It also covers damage to other structures on property such as a garage or shed, personal property such as appliances, personal liability, and fair rental value.</p>\n<p>Investment property owners can simply go to Kin’s website, enter the property’s address, and get a quote in a few easy steps.</p>\n<p>Kin is the only insurtech company to currently offer homeowners insurance in both Florida and California.

We remain committed to ensuring Floridians have access to insurance at a low cost.”</p>\n<p>Kin’s customers currently save an average of $500.

As a result, customers rate Kin #1 on multiple platforms, citing easy savings, personalized coverage, world-class service, and super fast claims.</p>\n<p><strong>About Kin</strong></p>\n<p>Kin is an insurance technology company that’s changing home insurance from what it is to what it should be.

      body: "<p><strong>CHICAGO, IL –&nbsp;August 1, 2017 –</strong> Kin, the company that has built home insurance from scratch so that customers can get the best insurance entire online, in minutes, launched today in its first state, Florida. Since Kin is built on modern technology without paper and legacy IT systems, and does not rely on local brokers for distribution, Kin also provides a better value – more insurance for less money.</p>\n<p>Kin was founded in 2016 by financial technology veterans Sean Harper, Lucas Ward, and Sebastian Villarreal, who have previously built and sold financial technology businesses to Groupon, Insight Venture Partners and Avant.</p>\n<p>Along with the launch, Kin raised $4 million from top venture capitalists including Commerce Ventures, Omidyar Network, 500 Startups, Chicago Ventures, and Portag3 Ventures, as well as top angels including founders and alumni from other top tech companies such as Avant, Square, Capital One, LinkedIn and Facebook. “Insurance is a huge part of the economy that hasn’t seen much tech innovation. We are excited to back such an experienced team solving big problems in a giant industry,” said Dan Rosen, founder and managing director of Commerce Ventures.</p>\n<p>Kin can provide a seamless and instant customer experience because it plugs into every available data source about each house. Historically, insurance companies have relied on the homeowner and the insurance agent to provide information about the house, which is inconvenient for the customer but also that data isn’t very reliable.</p>\n<p>“Even if users liked filling out long questionnaires about their houses, most people don’t really know what condition their roof is in, or the replacement cost of their house. As techies with big data experience, we can quickly plug into new data sources and build models that really understand the home a lot better than the owner or an insurance agent” said Lucas Ward, CTO of Kin.</p>\n<p>By starting from scratch and cutting out unnecessary costs, Kin can provide a better value to the consumer while still building a profitable business. “94% of homeowners insurance is still sold through local brokers and agents but only 24% of people under the age of 40 actually want to buy that way, and these are the people who are now buying the most houses. There are more insurance offices than fast food restaurants, which is unnecessary and adds a lot of expense and results in higher prices for the consumer,” said Sean Harper, CEO of Kin.</p>"

Given the incredible success we achieved in the first half of the year, it was very important, for risk management purposes, that we throttle our growth a bit so we don’t exceed the amount of exposure for which our reinsurance program was designed,” said Sean Harper, CEO of Kin. “When we saw changes in the macroeconomic environment earlier this year, we adjusted our goals to focus less on growth and more on accelerating our path to profitability and ensuring the reciprocal exchange is self-sufficient. We’ve done a good job on delivering on those objectives.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/premium-renewal-rate-q3-2.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Kin’s premium renewal rate, an important driver of future premium and customer lifetime value, increased to 111% in the third quarter from 108% in the second quarter. Notably, Kin earned a single-month record with a 113% premium renewal rate in September.</p>\n<p>“Our direct-to-consumer model allows us to reduce and even eliminate many expenses associated with traditional ways of doing business in the insurance industry,” added Harper. “We’ve squeezed a lot of costs out of the process, using all of the efficiencies to give customers the affordable, necessary coverage that they need right now.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/adj-loss-ratio-v4.png\" alt=\"\" /><br />\nThrough the third quarter of 2022, Kin’s adjusted loss ratio, net of XOL recoveries, decreased to 46.6% from 81.7% in the prior-year period. Non-cat adjusted loss ratio was 38.1% through the third quarter of 2022, and has decreased on an inception basis each of the last seven quarters.</p>\n<p>“We continue to drive down our loss ratio with our accurate pricing and improved risk selection,” said Angel Conlin, Chief Insurance Officer at Kin. “This progress has carried over into the fourth quarter as well, and our losses from Hurricane Ian will be better relative to the industry due to our very proactive, technology-driven approach to support policyholders and triage claims.”</p>\n<p>Through the end of October, Kin has received approximately 7,000 claims related to <a href=\"https://www.kin.com/news/kin-insurance-provides-hurricane-ian-update/\">Hurricane Ian</a>, the Category 4 storm that made landfall in Florida on September 28, 2022. Kin’s <a href=\"https://www.kin.com/news/kin-enhances-reinsurance-program/\">XOL reinsurance program</a> is set up such that it retains only the first $2.5 million of exposure from the storm, with an affiliated reinsurer retaining an additional $2.5 million.

      body: "<p><strong>CHICAGO, IL –&nbsp;April 8, 2020 –</strong>&nbsp;Today, Cape Analytics is announcing that Kin, a fully licensed home insurance technology company that provides easy, affordable coverage to homeowners in catastrophe-prone regions, has expanded its partnership with Cape Analytics. Kin is using Cape Analytics’ geospatial property intelligence to inform its homeowner insurance offering and provide customers the best possible coverage at the lowest price with the least hassle. By utilizing Cape Analytics for remote risk assessment, Kin is continuing to write policies and serve customers, while maintaining social distancing rules that keep customers and employees safe.</p>\n<p>Cape Analytics is providing Kin with the most comprehensive, timely, and accurate property information available, by leveraging geospatial imagery, computer vision, and machine learning. The integration of Cape Analytics’ data allows Kin to provide customers with policies tailored to individual property and coverage needs. Cape Analytics automatically provides information such as roof condition, roof type, tree coverage, and presence of a swimming pool, allowing Kin customers to get the right coverage faster.</p>\n<p>Kin is using this new form of instant property intelligence in innovative ways by leveraging property attributes that are related to geo-specific risks. For example, in a wind-prone state like Florida, Kin can access Cape’s wind-related property attributes such as roof type and the presence of pool enclosures. In states with higher risk of wildfire, Kin may automatically retrieve Cape information regarding vegetation coverage surrounding a structure. In precipitation-heavy areas, Cape’s loss-predictive Roof Condition Rating can allow Kin to better understand the potential of a property experiencing water damage from a leaking roof.</p>\n<p>In a recent study of Hurricane Irma, Cape Analytics found that Florida homes with roofs in poor or severe condition were far more vulnerable and had a 45% higher chance of suffering major damage. In addition, 65% of homes affected by the hurricane took more than six months to repair. Kin is leveraging these and other insights to decrease customer risk while improving their experience.</p>\n<p>“Our platform is built from the ground up to seamlessly integrate industry-leading sources of data, which is exactly what Cape Analytics provides. As a result, we can leverage our machine learning prediction framework to instantly assess risk and customize coverage and prices through our super simple online experience,” said Blake Konrardy, VP of product at Kin.</p>\n<p>“We are thrilled to have a growing partnership with an innovative, data-first carrier like Kin where we can enable them to expand usage in alignment with their rapid growth as an upstart insurer,” said Busy Cummings, VP of sales at Cape Analytics.</p>\n<p>Both companies have received outstanding recognition in recent months: <em>Fast Company</em> named Kin one of the most innovative finance companies of 2020, while <em>Insurance Insider</em> shortlisted Cape Analytics as 2020 InsurTech of the Year.</p>\n<p><strong>About Cape Analytics</strong></p>\n<p>Cape Analytics was established in 2014 to revolutionize the way property information is created and used. The company leverages geospatial imagery, computer vision, and machine learning to instantly and automatically extract proprietary property data for insurance carriers and other property stakeholders. Cape Analytics establishes a new category of property data, offering immediacy and coverage comparable to pre-filled data, but with accuracy and detail that previously required time-consuming in-person inspection reports. Cape Analytics seamlessly integrates into carrier quote engines via API.

      body: "<p><strong>CHICAGO, IL – October 21, 2022 –</strong> Kin, the direct-to-consumer home insurance company built for every new normal, today announced select preliminary outcomes surrounding Hurricane Ian, the Category 4 storm that made landfall in Florida on September 28, 2022.</p>\n<p>To date, Kin has received approximately 6,800 claims, which will incur an overall gross ultimate loss that is well below its $800 million overall <a href=\"https://www.kin.com/news/kin-enhances-reinsurance-program/\">reinsurance tower</a>. The projected net exposure of the Kin Interinsurance Network, a reciprocal exchange, is $2.5 million, while Kin Insurance, Inc., through its ownership of its captive reinsurer Kincession, Ltd., has a projected net exposure of $2.5 million.</p>\n<p>“Between our strong reinsurance program and our continuous investments in technology, operations, staffing, and partnerships, we were well-prepared to handle a major catastrophe like Ian,” said Sean Harper, CEO of Kin. “As a result, we delivered the best possible experience for our customers, who experienced a range of damage and hardship, and our important work continues to ensure their claims are handled quickly and efficiently.”</p>\n<p>As a trusted and financially stable carrier, Kin took a very proactive, technology-driven approach to support policyholders and triage claims:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Predicted Hurricane Ian’s path:</strong> Kin used geospatial data from the National Hurricane Center and other sources and layered it on top of its book of business to better understand how customers would be impacted by the storm. Kin ultimately had 23,819 insured risks in the wind field footprint with wind speeds of 50mph or higher.</li>\n<li><strong>Alerted policyholders:</strong> Kin triggered its automated pre-event text messages to customers who would be vulnerable to damage, and provided them with custom resources and tips to keep them and their property safe.</li>\n<li><strong>Performed wellness checks:</strong> 80,000 wellness check text messages were sent to customers based on their location and wind speeds. With a 50%+ response rate, Kin verified the safety of its policyholders, received real-time updates on the ground impact of the storm, and got claims started quickly via online submission, phone call, or text message for people in low-bandwidth environments.</li>\n<li><strong>Leveraged aerial imagery:</strong> Kin used imagery captured by airplanes flying after the storm to analyze 40,000 insured locations. Because many customers were evacuated, this enabled Kin to initiate the claims process much faster, unlike traditional insurers that must wait longer to send human adjusters to assess damage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>“Technology and data science are really important in insurance, and they’re at the center of everything that we do to help customers and meet them where they are,” said Angel Conlin, Chief Insurance Officer at Kin. “We could accurately predict which policyholders were going to feel the effects of Ian, and our claims team was ready to provide immediate help and put them on a path to recovery.”</p>\n<p>Harper added: “The aftermath of any storm is when it’s most important for us to get in contact with our customers; they really like how proactive we are in our communication. Being proactive also helps us to get ahead of the claims process and find solutions for customers before predatory attorneys and other third parties get involved which, unfortunately, is why the Florida property market is in turmoil.”</p>\n<p>Kin continues to accept claims notices from impacted policyholders and the fastest way to get started is to submit at <a href=\"https://www.kin.com/claims/\">kin.com/claims</a> or call 866-204-2219.</p>\n<p><strong>About Kin</strong></p>\n<p>Kin is the home insurance company for every new normal.

      body: "<p><strong>CHICAGO, IL –&nbsp;June 11, 2018 –</strong>&nbsp;Kin, an insurtech startup that’s simplifying and transforming home insurance, closed $13 million in funding so it can help protect homeowners nationwide. Kin also welcomed Caribou Honig, chairman and cofounder of the InsureTech Connect conference and a founding partner of the boutique venture capital firm QED Investors, to its board.</p>\n<p>Since its official launch in 2017, Kin has provided home insurance in Florida and Texas, but plans to make its offerings available nationally by the year’s end. Its latest round of financing, backed by the Silicon Valley VC firm August Capital, will help the company launch new products over the next two quarters. Previously, Kin raised $4 million from leading venture capitalists and angel investors, among them Commerce Ventures, Omidyar Network, 500 Startups, Chicago Ventures, and Portag3 Ventures.</p>\n<p>Seasoned insurtech veteran Honig brings years of insurance and data-driven marketing experience to this next stage of growth for the company. His expertise will help guide key decisions as Kin expands its reach.</p>\n<p>“The insurance industry is long overdue for change,” said Honig. “It’s exciting to work with a company that can see beyond the status quo. Instead of slightly improving the product, Kin aims to reinvent home insurance.”</p>\n<p>Historically, buying home insurance meant long applications, complex policies, limited offerings, and time lost on the phone with a local broker. Kin created an all-online process that prioritizes simplicity, affordability, and convenience. Homeowners can get a quote in seconds with just their address, and Kin can insure homes in riskier regions that are often overlooked by big insurance companies.</p>\n<p>“Owning a home is challenging enough. We think insuring it should be easy,” said Sean Harper, CEO of Kin. “Some home insurance applications are so complicated you’d have to be a home inspector to accurately fill them out. So we rely on data to tell us what we need to know about the home. It saves the homeowner legwork and lets us offer the right coverage at a good price. That’s the kind of change we want to bring to the national level.”</p>"

Even if the storm had created much greater losses, the carrier’s financials would have been protected.”</p>\n<p>“Historically, the third quarter tends to have higher loss ratios, driven by larger amounts of extreme weather, only to be improved upon during the fourth quarter,” said Kin Chief Financial Officer Josh Cohen. “We’re pleased that we’re tracking ahead of that trend this year.”</p>\n<p>These preliminary results through October 31, 2021 and for the third quarter ended September 30, 2021 are based on the information available to us at this time.

      body: "<p><strong>CHICAGO, IL – January 17, 2023</strong> – Kin, the direct-to-consumer home insurance company built for every new normal®, today announced its expansion into South Carolina. Kin is entering the Palmetto State to offer a seamless way for homeowners and landlords to protect their most valuable assets, despite being exposed to several risks.</p>\n<p>South Carolina's proximity to the Atlantic Coast makes it vulnerable to extreme weather – it ranks among the <a href=\"https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd-faq/#landfalls-by-state\">top 10 states</a> for hurricane risk and has a nearly <a href=\"https://www.dnr.sc.gov/climate/sco/hurricanes/pdfs/SCHurricanesExecutiveSummary.pdf\">80% chance</a> of being affected by a tropical system each year. Because the average size of a tropical system is approximately <a href=\"https://www.dnr.sc.gov/climate/sco/hurricanes/pdfs/SCHurricanesExecutiveSummary.pdf\">300 miles in diameter</a>, more than five million residents are susceptible to high winds, heavy rain, and tornadoes. The impacted population will likely increase in the coming years, as South Carolina was the <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2022/2022-population-estimates.html\">third fastest-growing state</a> in 2022.</p>\n<p>“We can’t change the weather in South Carolina, but we can save people substantial time, stress, and money when it comes to protecting their home,” said Sean Harper, CEO of Kin. “Our technology enables us to reduce and even eliminate many of the steps and expenses associated with traditional ways of doing business in the insurance industry. From quote to claim, everything we do is designed to deliver the best possible experience for the customer.”</p>\n<p>Kin combines proprietary technology with personalized, high-touch assistance to customize policies that suit customers’ needs. By factoring in property records, permit data, and aerial imagery, among other sources, Kin gains the best possible understanding of the physical properties of homes and how they will be impacted by extreme weather. This helps customers receive the right coverage for the right price, and then Kin supports them over a continuum to ensure their safety and wellbeing.</p>\n<p>South Carolina is the first state where Kin is offering coverage through its new reciprocal exchange, which has a Financial Stability Rating of A, Exceptional, from Demotech and is regulated just like any other insurance company, but it’s owned by Kin’s customers.</p>\n<p>South Carolina residents can learn more and receive a quote by visiting <a href=\"https://www.kin.com/home-insurance/south-carolina/\">www.kin.com/home-insurance/south-carolina</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>About Kin</strong></p>\n<p>Kin is the only pure-play, direct-to-consumer digital insurer focused on the growing homeowners insurance market. Kin makes homeowners insurance more convenient and affordable by eliminating the need for external agents. Kin’s technology platform delivers a seamless user experience, customized options for coverage, and fast, high-quality claims service.

The swift actions we took earlier in the year enabled us to still grow fast and efficiently, while limiting our exposure, and now we’re realizing better profitability metrics,” said Sean Harper, CEO of Kin. “We nearly landed our premium growth target, beat our CAC target by 24%, beat our reciprocal loss ratio target by 3%, and turned a positive operating income in the fourth quarter. That’s a very strong year by any measure.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/alr-v2.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Hurricane Nicole contributed 8.5% to the Reciprocal Exchange’s adjusted loss ratio in the fourth quarter of 2022, with all CAT activity contributing 14.1% for the year. Of the $175 million in ultimate expected loss &amp; LAE from Hurricanes Ian and Nicole, 97% was ceded to reinsurers under Kin’s XOL reinsurance program. The Reciprocal Exchange’s adjusted loss ratio, net of XOL recoveries, was 49.2% in 2022. Non-CAT adjusted loss ratio was a record-low 28.6% in the fourth quarter of 2022, and ended at 35.1% for the year.</p>\n<p>“We’re continuing to see very favorable trends with non-CAT adjusted loss ratio, which has decreased each of the last eight quarters,” said Angel Conlin, chief insurance officer at Kin. “We’re very pleased with our performance for both hurricanes. We kept the focus on our customers and are delivering projected loss results that outperform the modeled estimates.”</p>\n<p>Notably, Kin has a higher claims closure rate (78.1%) and lower claims open without payment rate (10.1%) compared to industry averages for Hurricane Ian, according to the <a href=\"https://www.floir.com/home/ian\">Florida Office of Insurance Regulation</a>. This is due largely to Kin’s proactive, technology-driven approach to support customers and triage claims. Before the storm, Kin messaged customers about their potential risk, accurately predicted the likely number of impacted properties, and readied resources to assist customers quickly. After landfall, Kin again communicated with customers while also using weather data, aerial imagery, and other information sources to identify those with the worst impacts. As a result of its forward planning and preparedness, Kin provided support to more than 50% of total claimants within the first five days of recovery.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/kin-more-than-doubles-gwp-in-2022-premium-renewal-rate.png\" alt=\"\" /><br />\nKin’s premium renewal rate increased steadily throughout 2022, ultimately hitting a record high of 120% in the fourth quarter of 2022, which also represented a 53% increase in gross written premium over the prior-year period.</p>\n<p>“Historically, insurance is a low-touch industry where insurers seldomly interact with their customers. We’re changing that paradigm to make home insurance easier and friendlier for people, especially those who live in catastrophe-prone states where they need a reliable option for coverage,” added Harper. “Our high renewal rates reinforce our strong ability to support customers through our direct model and human-centered design.”</p>\n<p>Kin consistently outpaces other insurance companies on customer satisfaction, as evidenced by its 3,000+ reviews and 4.6 average rating on Trustpilot (category average rating is 3.8).</p>\n<p><strong>About Kin</strong></p>\n<p>Kin is the only pure-play, direct-to-consumer digital insurer focused on the growing homeowners insurance market.

      body: "<p><strong>CHICAGO, IL – March 23, 2021 –</strong>&nbsp;Kin, the insurance technology company transforming home insurance through intuitive tech and affordable pricing, today announced that its agency, the Kin Insurance Network Distributor (KIND), a licensed surplus lines producer, will be offering homeowners insurance in Louisiana. Currently, Kin is the only insurtech company to offer homeowners insurance in both Florida and California and has earned national recognition for delivering affordable options to homeowners in these underserved states.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/louisiana/\">Louisiana homeowners</a> pay more for home insurance than any other state in the country because of its hurricane and flood exposure. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-hurricanes\">843,349 Louisiana single-family homes</a> are vulnerable to a Category 5 hurricane like Hurricane Katrina. Many insurance companies have responded to this risk by leaving the state or increasing rates to unaffordable levels. Kin takes a different approach, relying on data models that provide over 10,000 property data points to find coverage accurately priced for each home.</p>\n<p>KIND can offer Louisiana HO3 coverage through the Kin Interinsurance Network, rated A, Exceptional, by Demotech, a testament to the underwriter’s ability to pay out claims even after widespread disasters.</p>\n<p>“Everyone deserves access to affordable, easy homeowners insurance,” said Sean Harper, co-founder and CEO of Kin. “The insurance industry has ignored the realities of our changing risk landscape for far too long. We’re entering the Louisiana marketplace to offer a seamless way for homeowners to protect their most valuable asset.”</p>\n<p>The Louisiana homeowners policy can cover the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The dwelling, including walls, foundation, roof, floors, electric, and plumbing.</li>\n<li>Belongings, such as clothing, furniture, electronics, appliances, and more.</li>\n<li>Other structures that aren’t attached to the home, like garages, fences, and greenhouses.</li>\n<li>Loss of use coverage for additional living expenses during a covered claim.</li>\n<li>Personal liability coverage for third-party property damage or bodily harm.</li>\n<li>Medical expense payments for small visitor injuries.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Kin’s data-centric approach to home insurance has earned national recognition and propelled the company to a total insured value of more than $10 billion.</p>\n<p>The company consistently outpaces traditional insurance companies on customer satisfaction. Kin’s Net Promoter Score (which indicates the likelihood that a customer would recommend a company to a friend) is 85, more than double the industry average of 35.</p>\n<p><strong>About Kin</strong></p>\n<p>Kin is an insurance technology company that’s changing home insurance from what it is to what it should be. By leveraging thousands of property data points, Kin customizes coverage and prices through a super simple user experience. Kin offers homeowners, landlord, condo, and mobile home insurance through the Kin Interinsurance Network (KIN), a reciprocal exchange owned by its customers who share in the underwriting profit.

(“Kin”), an insurance technology company that makes home insurance easy and affordable, and Omnichannel Acquisition Corp. (NYSE: OCA) (“Omnichannel”), a publicly-traded special purpose acquisition company led by serial entrepreneur Matt Higgins and a deep bench of consumer operators, announced today that they have entered into a definitive business combination agreement. Upon closing of the transaction, the combined company will be named Kin Insurance, Inc. and is expected to be listed on the NYSE under the new ticker symbol “KI”.</p>\n<p>Kin, which currently operates in Florida, Louisiana, and California, also announced today it has accelerated its ability to enter into new markets by signing a stock purchase agreement to acquire an inactive insurance carrier that holds licenses in more than 40 states. The proposed acquisition of the inactive insurance carrier and the business combination are both expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2021 following the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval, and in the case of the business combination, shareholder approval. As Kin looks to soon expand its reach into new markets, the company announced NBA superstar Draymond Green joined four-time major champion golf pro Rory McIlroy in the recent Series C round as an investor, both of whom will assist in raising Kin’s profile across the country in current markets and in new geographies.</p>\n<p><strong>Company Overview</strong></p>\n<p>Kin is the only pure-play direct-to-consumer digital insurer focused on the complex and growing $100+ billion homeowners insurance market. Kin’s proprietary technology enables customers to insure their homes in minutes online, bringing convenience to a historically manual process. Future customer needs such as making a policy change or filing a claim are similarly automated and convenient. Behind the scenes, Kin utilizes thousands of data points about each property to provide accurate pricing and produce better underwriting results.</p>\n<p>Because Kin has eliminated the need for an external agent and has replaced antiquated insurance technology with modern, more efficient technology, Kin can offer attractive pricing to customers without sacrificing margins.</p>\n<p>Kin’s low cost structure, fast reaction time and data advantage enable Kin to adapt better to the increasingly volatile weather occurring throughout the country as the climate warms. The residential property market cannot function without homeowners insurance, because insurance is required by most mortgage lenders. By stepping into climate-impacted areas and offering cost-efficient insurance priced with sophisticated climate models, Kin plays a key part in helping our society adapt to climate change.</p>\n<p>Kin appeals to customers of all ages, with an average customer age of 57, unusual for direct to consumer brands, which typically service younger customers. Kin’s customers have relatively high spending power, are embracing technology and generally recommend businesses they love to their friends and family. This provides Kin with a wealth of future cross-sell opportunities for existing and new customers with respect to potential additional home-related and insurance products.</p>\n<p><strong>Management Comments</strong></p>\n<p>“The home insurance industry has been coasting for years on legacy technology and an antiquated way of interacting with customers. It is more than ripe for an innovative alternative and that is exactly why we created Kin – to provide customers with a better home insurance offering, better pricing and an overall better experience,” said Sean Harper, co-founder and CEO of Kin.</p>\n<p>“Access to affordable home insurance is challenging in regions that are impacted by climate change and severe weather; at Kin, our proprietary technology and deep data advantage enables us to best evaluate risk and price home insurance fairly for consumers. Our customers receive a simple, direct and exceptional experience that provides them with real savings and leaves them delighted and loyal to Kin. As a result, we are growing fast, generating attractive unit economics, and we believe we are well-positioned to significantly expand our market share moving forward.”</p>\n<p>“Today’s announcement is a major milestone and validation of what we have built, as well as an important next step in our development,” continued Harper. “We are excited to enter the public markets with Matt Higgins and the incredible team at Omnichannel, who have a proven track record of building enduring direct-to-consumer brands, making them the perfect complement for Kin. We expect to use our strengthened balance sheet to further scale our platform to new geographies, accelerating the growth of our premiums and profitability. Consumers deserve an easy, affordable and personalized insurance experience, and at Kin, we are building the home for better insurance.”</p>\n<p>“The Kin team has leveraged their decades of insurance and fintech experience to build a capital efficient company that is experiencing outstanding growth across the board, along with compelling and superior unit economics,” said Matt Higgins, chairman and CEO of Omnichannel, who also co-teaches a course on digitally native brands at Harvard Business School. “Kin’s direct-to-consumer approach to insurance is a true differentiator and provides it with a clear-cut advantage versus the competition. As a result, Kin has an opportunity to reinvent and lead the massive homeowners insurance marketplace.

      body: "<p><strong>CHICAGO, IL – August 19, 2021 –</strong> Kin, the direct-to-consumer home insurance company built for every new normal, today announced its upgraded reinsurance program that offers greater disaster protection, proof of its financial strength and its commitment to serving catastrophe-exposed regions. Backed by more than 42 blue chip reinsurers, most with a financial rating of A- or higher by AM Best, Kin is dedicated to providing quality support and appropriately managing risks for homeowners who are most exposed to the mounting impact of climate change.</p>\n<p>Whereas financial stability rating reinsurance requirements mandate that a 1 in every 130 year loss be covered, Kin's program offers 160 year first-event loss protection. The program also includes more than $300 million in reinsurance for hurricane events.</p>\n<p>\"The most important service we provide to our customers is covering their damages for the rarest and strongest events,\" said Angel Conlin, chief insurance officer at Kin. \"Our robust reinsurance program ensures we can meet our obligations to our policyholders.\"</p>\n<p>As the effects of climate change accelerate across the U.S., extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, are becoming stronger and more frequent, increasing the likelihood of insured damage. Taller reinsurance protection acts as a necessary safeguard for both insureds and the company.</p>\n<p>Notably, Kin was able to reduce reinsurance costs as a percentage of premium while significantly reducing risk retention as a percent of premium. Despite growing premiums approximately 3x, first event retention remained at $5 million.</p>\n<p>Conlin added: \"Our main priority is to balance the cost and benefit of extreme event probabilities to best protect our policyholders.\"</p>\n<p>Kin's upgraded reinsurance program applies to all states and policies within the Kin Interinsurance Network.</p>\n<p><strong>About Kin</strong></p>\n<p>Kin is the home insurance company for every new normal.

      body: "<p><strong>CHICAGO, IL – March 22, 2023 –</strong> Kin, the direct-to-consumer home insurance company built for every new normal®, today announced that it conducted a third close, an incremental $15 million, to its Series D round in Q4 2022. The investment came from Geodesic Capital, QED Investors, and additional investors, bringing the total Series D funds raised to $109 million.</p>\n<p>Since the first close of its <a href=\"https://www.kin.com/news/kin-announces-first-close-in-series-d-funding/\">Series D round</a> in March 2022, Kin has continued its <a href=\"https://www.kin.com/news/kin-more-than-doubles-gwp-in-2022/\">systematic, capital efficient growth</a>, more than doubling its gross written premium while making gains in operational efficiency and driving toward profitability. The additional funding, which was provided using the same terms and valuation as the initial investment, strengthens Kin’s liquidity position and provides the company with the capital needed to significantly expand its offerings and market share moving forward.</p>\n<p>“Despite the tough market for high-growth companies right now, we’ve increased revenue 2.2x, improved each of our major operating metrics, and kept the same valuation. These are good outcomes, especially when other startups are accepting punishing terms or a valuation hit,” said Sean Harper, CEO of Kin. “We've been able to achieve these outcomes because the business has performed really well and we didn’t raise capital at the hype-driven multiples that many technology companies did in 2021.”</p>\n<p>Kin’s achievement of scalable unit economics while preserving consistent customer retention is what separates the company from its competitors. Kin’s premium renewal rate was 112% in 2022, and its cumulative customer lifetime value to customer acquisition cost ratio is 9.6x.</p>\n<p>“Homeowners insurance distribution is an acyclical market and Kin’s unit economics, which have always been good, have only continued to improve,” said Jon Rezneck, partner and head of the investment team at Geodesic Capital. “We were pleased for the opportunity to continue to support Kin by putting additional capital to work, further powering their mission to simplify and personalize home insurance.”</p>\n<p><strong>About Kin</strong></p>\n<p>Kin is the only pure-play, direct-to-consumer digital insurer focused on the growing homeowners insurance market. Kin makes homeowners insurance more convenient and affordable by eliminating the need for external agents. Kin’s technology platform delivers a seamless user experience, customized options for coverage, and fast, high-quality claims service. Behind the scenes, Kin utilizes thousands of data points about each property to provide accurate pricing and produce better underwriting results. Kin is a fully licensed carrier that offers coverage through its reciprocal exchanges which are owned by its customers.
